## User Guide

This is Homerow's workflow:
1. Activate via shortcut (default is `Command-Shift-Space`)
2. Search for the UI element to click on
3. Labels (aka dynamic shortcuts) will be shown for the UI elements matching the query. The green target is the current focused UI element.
4. There are two ways to focus the correct UI element:
    - Press `Tab` or `Arrow-Dn` until the correct UI element is focused
    - Type the UI element's label text while holding `Shift`
5. Press `Return` to perform a click on the focused UI element

There is an option to use the Labels-only workflow, which disables the search feature and allows you to type the label text without holding down `Shift`.

### Queries

1. Spaces and cases are ignored
2. `*` and `;` will query for all UI elements

### Not sure what to type? The Tutor ü§ì comes to the rescue!

<img width="701" alt="tutor" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34204380/205489888-ccd3993f-dd6c-4408-a45c-e76d19c94d28.png">

The Tutor shows you searchable properties of a UI element.

When Homerow is activated, you can call for the Tutor two ways:
1. Press `?` for Tutor to follow the focused UI element
2. Hover your cursor over the UI element

### Disable search for speed üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí®

Labels-only mode disables search. Labels for all UI elements are always shown, and label-text can be typed without holding `Shift`. You can click more ergonomically by pressing `Space` instead of `Return`.

Made for those who ‚ù§Ô∏è Vimium and Vimperator.

### Controls

### Pro-tip: Map Caps Lock to Hyper Key

You'll likely activate Homerow quite frequently, so make the controls as comfortable and as quick as possible for the best experience.

Three reasons to use Hyper Key:
1. Activate Homerow with `Caps Lock + F`
2. Focus the next or previous UI Element with `Caps Lock + J` and `Caps Lock + K` respectively.
3. Navigate menus with `Caps Lock + H/J/K/L`

How to set up Hyper Key:
1. [Hyperkey](https://hyperkey.app) by Ryan Hanson OR
2. Configure Karabiner-Elements
